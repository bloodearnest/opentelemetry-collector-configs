# OpenTelemetry Collector Distro

[We have plans](https://app.asana.com/0/1199917178609623/1200638496207367/f) to create a set of pre-compiled binaries & an installer that gets everything working quickly and easily.

## Building

Run `make`.

## Development

Watch updates and rebuild on changes using [`entr`](http://eradman.com/entrproject/) with `ls | entr make`.
